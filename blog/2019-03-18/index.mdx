More "advanced" is difficult to interpret. I can tell you what in my opinion leaves more stucco.

Just go to this address: [This Person Does Not Exist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) and a photo of a person appears.

Bright smile, clean face. In fact I would be curious to know her and let me tell her story. Who knows what job he does, if he has a family, if Sunday argues with his partner because of Ikea? Who knows how many things he would have to tell.

Only if this person existed though.

Instead it's just a picture of the endless faces that are generated by an AI every time you open this page:

Too bad, because I was already fond of it.
