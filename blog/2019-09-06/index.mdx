Based on a suggestion from Andrew Harpin, here are the The Soft Skills of Interviewing!

**Do your research** 
 + Check out company's social media
 + Look at Glassdoor reviews, but look for trends not individual opinions
 + Think of questions to ask during the interview based on your research

**Relax, Be Kind, Be yourself**
 + Meditate before going to an interview
 + Don't pretend to be someone you're not
 + Show your nerves a bit; you're a person, not an act2
 + Interviews are a good place to find out if the company will be a good fit for you!
 + Be excited and interested!

**Interview your Interviewer**
 + Choose questions to ask your interviewer that will help you determine if the company, manager, and group will be a good fit for you. Here are some examples:
 + What do you expect me to accomplish in the first 90 days?
 + What does a typical day in this position look like?
 + Do you have any reservations about hiring me for this position at this point? If so, what are they?
 + What could I learn now that would best prepare me to get started right away if I were hired?
 + What do you like most and you dislike most about what you do?

**ALWAYS send a thank-you note!**
 + Send a thank-you email within 24 hours of your interview
 + Reference something you talked about in your interview to make it more personal
