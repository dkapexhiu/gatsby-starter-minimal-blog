**I did not know HTML5 inputs supported validation using regex patterns**
```
<input type="text" id="uname" name="uname" pattern="[a-zA-Z0-9]+" minlength="4" maxlength="10"> 
```

**Styling #CSS ::placeholder**  
Use the ::placeholder pseudo element to style your placeholder text in an 
```<input> ``` or ```<textarea>``` form element. Most modern browsers support this, but for older browsers, vendor prefixes will be required.  
  
**Add subject and body to mailto links** 
```
<a href="mailto:info@example.com?subject=Check this&body=Hey, check this out.">Email us</a>  
```
  
**Native img lazy-loading**  
Native <img> lazy-loading is coming to the web! https://bit.ly/loading-attribute. 
```<img loading=lazy>``` defers offscreen images until the user scrolls near them. Shipping in Chrome ~75  
  
**Preload scripts**  
Is JavaScript critical for your site to be interactive? 
```
<link rel=preload>
```
can load these scripts at a higher priority: https://bit.ly/rel-preload . Improved Twitter Lite’s time to interactive by 36%, Tinder’s first contentful paint by 30%.  
  
**Preconnect to styles and scripts**
```
<link rel=preconnect>
```
is great for eliminating costly round-trips to important domains from the critical path: https://bit.ly/preconnect . Improved our Time To Interactive on http://Chrome.com  by almost ~1s. 
  
**Importance of a resource**  
Priority Hints: hint the "importance" of a resource to prioritize downloading it sooner/later
```
<img importance=low> 
<img importance=high> 
<img importance=auto>
```
Works on <img>, <link> and fetch()
