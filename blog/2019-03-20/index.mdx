What does it a mean an optimised webapp?
* it loads quickly,
* and, being loaded, it works quickly (meaning animations don’t skip frames, scrolling is smooth, and so on)

The site loads quickly when:
* the server responds to requests in a short time,
* and the app itself loads and renders quickly.

OPTIMISE JAVASCRIPT

* Minify the JS code
* Use async and defer for your scripts
* Split your code to load as few of it as possible
* And remove unused code from your dependencies

OPTIMISE CSS

* Minify the CSS code
* Extract critical CSS and fetch it first

HTTP OPTIMISATIONS

* Minify HTML, just like any other resource
* Compress text resources using Gzip and Brotli
* Use a CDN to save time on downloading your static resources
* Preload resources you know you’ll need later

OPTIMISE IMAGES

* Choose the proper image format
* Optimize image loading time by decreasing their dimensions, decreasing their quality, or making them progressive

FONT OPTIMISATIONS

* Specify the proper fallback font (and a generic font family)
* Use font-display to configure how the custom font is applied
