* Push to gitlab    
1. First clone the repository in your system by “ git clone https://user@bitbucket.org/codes...”  
2. Go into the repo by typing “cd repository” on your terminal. To view all the branches of your repo do “ git branch -a”  
3. To push to a particular branch do “git checkout samplebranch”  
4. Then when you enter “git branch”, the starred branch in green is your current branch  
5.”git status” will show all your uncommited hanges in red  
6. To stage them do “git add samplefolder”  
7. Then “git status” ,will show your staged changes in green.  
8. Commit these changes with “git commit -m “Whatever commit message you want to write”  
9. Then push these changes by “git push origin HEAD:samplebranch”.  

* Get remote changes from git  
1. git reset --hard origin/master  
2. git pull origin master  

* Return to a previous commit  
1. git reflog: shows a list of all the things you've done so far. It then allows you to use Git's time-traveling skills to go back to any point in the past  
2. git reset HEAD@{index}: If you want to go back to any point in the history, run the command, replacing {index} with that reference, e.g. egb38b3.  


* Symlink  
1. ln -s /home/sites/site.com/repo/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/mobile-menu /home/sites/site.com/public_html/wp-content/plugins/mobile-menu
