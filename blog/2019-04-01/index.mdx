Starting an online store is easier than ever these days.

But in order to remain successful, your e-commerce store needs a lot of things. In this article, we will show you some of the things you need in order to maximize the chances of success.

**Front-End Elements**  
"Front-end" are the things on your website that customers can see. You will need to gain the trust of your customers when they buy things from your store. This requires maximum time and attention.  

Let's take a look at some of the tools and techniques that can help build this trust and lead to maximizing sales.

**Contact info**  
The more ways a customer can achieve you, the better. You must display your address, phone number, and email at the end of each page.
Listing a phone number on your site will provide customers with a person to talk with their order.

**Live chat**  
Live Chat allows clients to query and get an instant response. If they can not get the information they need for a product on your site, they will buy it from a competitor of yours. With live chat, they can quickly get answers to their questions and you are more likely to keep them as future clients.

Live chat services integrate with most of the electronic commerce platforms. You can set live chat to be active during regular working hours, 24/7, or a different time period.

**Subscribe**  
Subscribe is a permission from a customer who gives the seller the right to send emails, information or messages. This is the most commonly used method by most firms. Initially, clients place their email and in the future they receive every email or information the seller sends. This method causes buyers to get continuous information from the store.

**Tracking wheelchairs**  
Â More than half of all people who put something in their online shopping cart do not complete the process. They value the shop, are distracted or surprised by the high transportation fees.

Whatever the reason, some customers may need an incentive to complete a purchase. Some e-commerce platforms provide automatic email notifications for people who have not completed the purchase.

**Location of pictures and descriptions**  
A picture is worth a thousand words. People will trust your store and your products if you have good product images. This means that photos and graphics should be of high resolution. Descriptions should be clear and accurate. Give customers all the details they need to make a decision that leads to the purchase.
