If you have a website, you know the importance of SEO. Without SEO, your site is not able to gain much traffic.

In this article, we will explain some of the most common SEO mistakes and how to avoid them.

**Overload with keywords**  
It is difficult to explain the importance of key words in SEO. There are many strategies but not all are effective.

A common mistake made by many beginners:

This is a case when many keywords are used repeatedly to provide the highest ranking in the search engines. However, this action causes more harm than good.

The reason is that Google gives priority to the quality of the content. Key words are effective in boosting SEO when they are naturally distributed throughout the content. Filling with keywords is likely to appear as "spam" in search engines by bringing your site below in the appendix.

Needless to say, you have to use keywords. Just make sure you be careful and include them in the right cases. They also need to fit well with your content.

**Not optimization of the site for mobile devices**  
Today, over 50% of all online traffic comes from mobiles and tablets. It's important to make sure your site works well on smaller screens and devices. Non-optimization of your site for mobile use will not only hurt the user experience but will have a negative impact on SEO.

Google has made it clear that cell phone optimization is a necessity if you want to get a high ranking. If you are not sure if your site meets these criteria, doing the test by Google will tell you that.

**Broken links**  
When you delete a page that was used as a link, enter an incorrect URL or change a URL address without updating the exact URL, a broken link is created. When visitors click on the link you set up they are directed to a page error404. Usually, most websites have broken links but it is very important to fix them as they have a negative impact on SEO.

One of the ways of listing pages on search engines is using links. Check for any link that is not functional and adjust it.
